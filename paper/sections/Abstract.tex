Image denoising is a crucial preprocessing step in various computer vision applications, yet remains challenging due to the diverse nature of noise and the trade-off between denoising efficacy and computational cost.  This paper introduces SaltNet, a multi-pathway, resource-efficient deep learning network for grayscale image denoising, designed to handle a range of noise types including Bernoulli, Poisson, Salt and Pepper, and Gaussian noise. SaltNet architecture integrates parallel pathways of Selective Convolutional (SeConv) blocks, adept denoising salt and pepper corrupted images\cite{Rafiee2021}, and novel Anisotropic Diffusion blocks, designed to smooth images while preserving structural details.  The features extracted from these pathways are fused and further refined by a shallow Transformer network, inspired by Restormer\cite{Zamir2022}, to capture long-range dependencies. Finally, an AutoEncoder, U-Net structure with skip connections, module serves as a post-processing stage to enhance perceptual quality\cite{Wu2022}.  Experimental results demonstrate that SaltNet achieves denoising performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods like Restormer, while exhibiting efficient resource utilization in terms of both runtime and memory consumption.
